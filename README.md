# EcoWish-Recommendation-System

EcoWish is an innovative e-commerce recommendation system designed to enhance user shopping experiences by suggesting products tailored to individual preferences. The system employs a combination of machine learning techniques to deliver personalized recommendations. It integrates user ratings, content-based, collaborative and hybrid recommendation approaches to provide accurate and relevant product suggestions.
The project features a website built with HTML, which serves as the front-end interface for users to interact with the recommendation system. Behind the scenes, Python is utilized to implement machine learning algorithms that analyze data and generate tailored recommendations. The data for this system comes from Walmart product datasets in CSV format, which are sourced from Kaggle and include details on product attributes and user ratings.
For managing data and facilitating interactions between the web interface and the recommendation algorithms, EcoWish uses XAMPP as its local server environment. XAMPP provides the necessary database management tools to store and retrieve data efficiently. By combining these components, EcoWish offers a comprehensive solution that leverages advanced technology to improve the online shopping experience.
